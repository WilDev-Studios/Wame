# Wame
Simple, Pythonic, Pygame Wrapper
- Latest Version `v0.7.0`
- Supports Python `3.7+`

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/wame/badge/?version=latest&style=for-the-badge)](https://wame.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

## What is Wame?
Wame was created as a backend Pygame wrapper, where all backend (and tedious) code is left in the background. This allows for events to be dispatched in specific event methods rather than in a messy manner like default Pygame and most other engine program loops.
This is primarily because handling the game backend and frontend in a singular file (or a couple) can be an eyesore, and Wame fixes this issue.

## What are Wame's features?
- Encapsulates Pygame's backend game programming
- Dispatches and calls methods needed to render and update game code, while executing events in a structured manner
- Allows on-demand scene switching (more about this later)
- Provides basic objects like font rendering (text), drawing, buttons, etc. (a pain to always make on many projects)

## How do I use Wame?
- Install `Wame` via `PyPI`: `pip install wame-engine`
- Import it into your program using `import wame`

## Documentation
You can find our documentation [here](https://wame.wildevstudios.net/)

## Getting Started
After installation:
- Instantiate a new `Engine` (runs the game loop and dispatches events)
- Define a new `~Scene` subclass (manages your objects and logic)
```python
import wame

class BasicScene(wame.Scene):
    def on_init(self, *args, **kwargs) -> None:
        ...
    
    def on_render(self) -> None:
        ...
    
    def on_update(self) -> None:
        ...

engine: wame.Engine = wame.Engine("Basic Game Window", wame.Pipeline.PYGAME)
engine.register_scene("Basic", BasicScene)
engine.set_scene("Basic")

engine.start()
```
This will create a fullscreen, black window. You can close it by pressing `ALT`+`F4`.
