# Wame Engine Changelog
We try to provide as much detail as possible so developers can understand which versions of `wame` they would like to develop with.

!!! danger "Disclaimer"
    `wame` is still currently in `beta` until our `1.0.0` release.
    Many of our features, objects, methods, etc. may be changed, and those changes may break programs.

!!! info
    Versions `0.0.1.dev1` - `0.3.0` changelogs were never recorded. Only versions `0.4.0`+ have changelogs.
