# Version 0.7.0
Released `May 17th, 2025`

## Breaking Changes
- `position` and `size` attributes removed from `UI` elements - Use internal `rect` instead.
- `UI` element changes:
    - Had `set_pixel_position`, `set_pixel_size`, `set_scaled_position`, and `set_scaled_size` replaced with `set_pixel_transform` and `set_scaled_transform`:
        - `Button`, `Frame`, `CheckboxInput`, and `TextInput`.
- `checkedColor` and `uncheckedColor` constructor parameters for `CheckboxInput` renamed to `checked_color` and `unchecked_color` to comply with convention.
- `textColor` and `yFlipped` constructor parameters for `TextInput` renamed to `text_color` and `y_flipped` to comply with convention.
- `Button` changes:
    - `scene` parameter now required - New first positional argument.
    - `check_click` and `check_hover` removed - `Scene` will handle these automatically.
- `CheckboxInput` changes:
    - `scene` parameter now required - New first positional argument.
    - `check_click` removed - `Scene` will handle these automatically.
- `TextInput` changes:
    - `scene` parameter now required - New first positional argument.
    - `check_click` and `check_key` removed - `Scene` will handle these automatically.
- `ColorRGB` and `ColorRGBA` `from_tuple` renamed to `from_iterable`.
- `Scene`.`__init__` should no longer be manually defined (as we are removing old boilerplate like `super()`). Use `on_init` instead.
- `Scene`.`on_init` now allows `**kwargs` to be passed from `Engine`.`set_scene`.

## Additions
- `Scene` `on_render` and `on_update` methods are no longer abstract - their implementation is again optional.
- `UI` element `rect` attributes are now no longer only readable properties - they can be directly written (Also allows future tweening, if implemented).
- `ColorRGB` and `ColorRGBA`:
    - `format()` now supported for other color representation conversions.
    - Get and set now supported via indices, i.e. `color[0]` or `color[1] = ...`.
    - Now hashable, so inserting into `set`s are supported.
    - Supports iterations and being iterated over.
    - New `.copy()` method.
    - New `.to_numpy()` conversion.
    - New `.hex()` color representation.
    - New `.int()` color representation.
- `ColorRGB`:
    - Now supports comparisons with other `ColorRGB` objects or `3`-length iterables.
    - New `.hsl()` color representation.
    - New `.hsv()` color representation.
- `ColorRGBA`:
    - Now supports comparisons with other `ColorRGBA` objects or `4`-length iterables.
    - New `.hsla()` color representation.
    - New `.hsva()` color representation.
- `Tween`:
    - `ColorRGB/A` now supported.
- New `FPS`/`delta_time` framework. `Pygame`'s internal timing is unreliable.
- `__slots__` to all instantiable classes to decrease object memory and increase lookup speed (`~10%` increase in FPS).

## Fixes
- Docstrings and type annotations for `UI` elements with `set_scaled_size` called for `IntVector2` rather than `FloatVector2`.
- `Scene` event handler for `WINDOWRESIZED` event was dispatching an `IntVector2` generated from non-existent `size` event attribute, rather than `x` and `y`.
- Various docstring and type annotation fixes - Improved/clarified annotation types.
- Dropped support for `Engine`.`set_background` taking a `ColorRGBA` object, as `Pygame` doesn't support window alpha values - The `a` value is now dropped.
- Minor performance tweaks in heavily-executed loops and function calls.
- `Engine`.`set_update_interval` expected `Interval` in the internal logic, but never accounted for when an `int` or `float` was passed.
