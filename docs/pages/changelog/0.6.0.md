# Version 0.6.0
Released `UNRELEASED`

## Breaking Changes
- `Vector`.`from_tuple` name change to `from_iterable` and supports `Vector` of the same dimension, `numpy` arrays, `tuple`, or `list`.
- `Vectors` can now only interact with objects of it's own type (`~IntVector` cannot interact with `~FloatVector`, vice versa, etc.)

## Additions
- `Vector` object changes:
    - `2D` vectors inherit `BaseVector2`, `3D` vectors inherit `BaseVector3`, to which both `BaseVector2/3` inherit `BaseVector`.
    - Now use `numpy.ndarray` in the backend instead of hard-coded attributes like `x`, `y`, and `z`.
    - Memory footprint of each is slightly smaller due to implementation of `__slots__`.
    - Differences between all old and new `Vector` objects:
        - `abs()` now supported (measures `magnitude`)
        - `bool()` now supported (`True` if `magnitude` is `> 0` otherwise `False`)
        - `len()` now supported (`2D` is always `2`, `3D` is always `3`)
        - `iter()` now supported as well as unpacking (gets internal `x` and `y` - `z` if `3D`)
        - `>=` conditionals now supported
        - `v[0]` and `v[1]` get and set now supported
        - `>` conditionals now supported
        - `//` arithmetic now supported
        - `<=` conditionals now supported
        - `<` conditionals now supported
        - `*` arithmetic now supported
        - `-` negative/flip arithmetic now supported
        - Reversed `+` and `-` arithmetic now supported
        - `str()` now supported (to print values if necessary)
        - `/` arithmetic now supported
        - `copy()` method addition
        - `dot()` method addition
        - `magnitude()` method addition
        - `normalize()` method addition
