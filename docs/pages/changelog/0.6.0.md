# Version 0.6.0
Released `May 14th, 2025`

## Breaking Changes
- `Vector`.`from_tuple` name change to `from_iterable` and supports `Vector` of the same dimension, `numpy` arrays, `tuple`, or `list`.
- `Vectors` can now only interact with objects of it's own type (`~IntVector` cannot interact with `~FloatVector`, vice versa, etc.).
- `Interval` will not longer be found in the `common` module and will now come with `wame` as is.
- `Common` module now renamed to `Utils`. This reflects new changes with developer utilities and QoL features.

## Additions
- `Vector` object changes:
    - `2D` vectors inherit `BaseVector2`, `3D` vectors inherit `BaseVector3`, to which both `BaseVector2/3` inherit `BaseVector`.
    - Now use `numpy.ndarray` in the backend instead of hard-coded attributes like `x`, `y`, and `z`.
    - Memory footprint of each is slightly smaller due to implementation of `__slots__`.
    - Differences between all old and new `Vector` objects:
        - `abs()` now supported (measures `magnitude`)
        - `len()` now supported (`2D` is always `2`, `3D` is always `3`)
        - `iter()` now supported as well as unpacking (gets internal `x` and `y` - `z` if `3D`)
        - `>=` conditionals now supported
        - `v[0]` and `v[1]` get and set now supported
        - `>` conditionals now supported
        - `//` arithmetic now supported
        - `<=` conditionals now supported
        - `<` conditionals now supported
        - `*` arithmetic now supported
        - `-` negative/flip arithmetic now supported
        - Reversed `+` and `-` arithmetic now supported
        - `str()` now supported (to print values if necessary)
        - `/` arithmetic now supported
        - `copy()` method addition
        - `dot()` method addition
        - `magnitude()` method addition
        - `normalize()` method addition
- Steppable game loop in the `Engine` (to support custom GUI applications rather than games):
    - If you'd like to render frames only when you ask the `Engine` to:
    - Disable the game loop using `Engine`.`set_game_loop_enabled(False)` (`True` to switch back).
    - Poll the update/render `Scene` methods using `Engine`.`step_game_loop`.
- `Pipeline` now inherits `enum.Enum` instead of using raw `int` values in place of `PYGAME` and `OPENGL`.
- `Interval` now inherits `enum.Enum`.
- New `Tween` object:
    - Animates various objects' (like `UI` elements, `pygame.Rect`, etc.) size, color, position, etc.
    - `Scene` has an instance of `Tween` under `Scene`.`tween`.
    - Uses easing methods like `LINEAR`, `QUAD_IN_OUT`, etc. under `wame.utils.Easing`.
